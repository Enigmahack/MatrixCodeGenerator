ToDo: 
Implement Crashing Effect
Implement Reverse Time Effect (Code slows down, stops, rewinds, and then a pulse blast resets the code to normal)
Implement Presets
Implement "Old Display" Effect
Implement a multi-monitor configuration? 
Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG?
Implement a Shader Plugin feature (custom shaders)
Implement a "Trigger with X key" to accept user inputs to create code effects
Implement a "Desync" tracer for speed variance on tracer streams so they can go different speeds.
