ToDo: 
Go through code and fix all comments. [DONE]

<- Behavior:
UI: Add option for double-clicking/tapping sliders to reset to default. [DONE]
UI: Add manual numeric input when clicking slider values. [DONE]
Quantized Editor: Scroll to advance/rewind animation steps. [DONE]
Quantized Effects: Fixed shadow world behavior by implementing a deep warmup simulation (Fast Forward) to ensure full density and correct eraser/tracer logic upon reveal. [DONE]
- Fixed 'disappearing columns' bug by ensuring `streamsPerColumn` and `cellLocks` are correctly synced/cleared during state transfer in `SimulationWorker.js`. [DONE]
- Fixed 'horizontal bar' / rounding artifacts by using floor/ceil expansion for shadow override regions, ensuring gapless coverage. [DONE]

<- Look:
Quantized Pulse Effect: Re-implement the grid overlap effect (Gold glow, 4x4 grid). [DONE]

Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. [DONE]

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. [DONE]
