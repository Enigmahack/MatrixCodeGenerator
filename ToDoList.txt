ToDo: 
Implement a multi-monitor configuration? 
Implement Reverse Time Effect (Code slows down, stops, rewinds, and then a pulse blast resets the code to normal)
Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper?

Bugs: 
Burst and Clear Burst: They illuminate both states at the same time instead of only the original/current - decide on one. 

Behavior: 
Reverse Time - Does nothing. (Address later on)

Look: 
Superman - Additional Glow + Voltage Glow does nothing, and Voltage glow should be put directly under Additional Glow and be called "Glow amount" instead of Voltage Glow. 

Star Power - Make the glitter do something different, like a luminscent effect through the entire star power stream. Also, full stream mode doesn't work.
