ToDo: 
Go through code and fix all comments.

<- Bugs: 
Fix performance for low-end machines [DONE - Enabled SharedArrayBuffer in Electron]

<- Behavior:

<- Look:
Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. [DONE]

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. [DONE]

Star Power - Make the glitter use the glimmer effect. [DONE]

Implement a multi-monitor configuration? [DONE - Basic support in main.js]

Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper? [DONE - Added electron-builder config]

Prompt for quantized pulse performance fix: 

The blocky cross at the beginning must remain as it was. The main issue is that as the expansion
  extends outward, the filling slows down. There must be a problem within the searching algorithmn.
  Instead, let's start with an expansion map. The map should contain the pre-calculated map of where
  all 1x1 blocks would be. As the blocks are being filled in, they should be registered on the map,
  so the search algorithm doesn't need to look, it can identify immediately which blocks have not yet
  been filled. Implement this map, and update the algorithm to only fill blocks that are not yet
  filled within the perimeter of the larger blob.
