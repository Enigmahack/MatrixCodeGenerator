ToDo: 
Implement a multi-monitor configuration? 
Implement Reverse Time Effect (Code slows down, stops, rewinds, and then a pulse blast resets the code to normal)
Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper?

Bugs: 
Deja Vu - The background characters are not random
Superman - The diagonal lightning doesn't appear, nor do the black sheets
Star Power - remove the glitter UI
Fire Wall - WebGLRenderer.js:77 Rendering Engine: WebGL (v8 CellGrid Optimized Fixed)
GlyphAtlas.js:157 [GlyphAtlas] Optimizing: Reducing rainbow to 4 steps to fit atlas limit.
FirewallEffect.js:78 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of undefined (setting '39')
Reverse Time - Does nothing. (Address later on)
Rotators - They should always complete their rotation and never be stuck half-way
Trail Ghosting - Doesn't work
Character Overlap - Well, it overlaps but it doesn't only show intersections. 
Tracer Glow - introduces flicker at the bottom of the screen, and increases overall glow, not just tracer glow. 
Code Glow - looks almost quantized, should be smoother.
