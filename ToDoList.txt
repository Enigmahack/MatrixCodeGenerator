ToDo: 
Implement a multi-monitor configuration? 
Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper?

<- Bugs: 
3D mode needs some refining but overall should be OK right now. Perhaps performance optimizations. 
Also check the Y axis inversion settings. 

Reverse tracer mode: 
Fix the upwards glow - should be white, and has it's own trail settings. 

<- Behavior: 

<- Look:
Resurrection Pulse: The rectangular grid stretch and rescale pulse effect shown in resurrections.

Image interpolation? 

3D mode
(WIP, needs behaviour fixing)

 
Star Power - Make the glitter do something different, like a luminscent effect through the entire star power stream. Also, full stream mode doesn't work.
