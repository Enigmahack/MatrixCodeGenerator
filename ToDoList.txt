ToDo: 
Implement a multi-monitor configuration? 
Implement Reverse Time Effect (Code slows down, stops, rewinds, and then a pulse blast resets the code to normal)
Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper?

Bugs: 

Behavior: 

Look:
Backwards tracer: an invisible tracer that moves up the stream, highlighting characters along the way.
Resurrection Pulse: The rectangular grid stretch and rescale pulse effect shown in resurrections. 
Star Power - Make the glitter do something different, like a luminscent effect through the entire star power stream. Also, full stream mode doesn't work.
