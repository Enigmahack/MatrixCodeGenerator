ToDo: 
<- Bugs: 

<- Behavior:
[ ] 3. Abstract Configuration Mapping: Dynamically generate UI controls in UIManager.js based on ConfigTemplate.
[ ] 5. Effect Initialization: Implement EffectRegistry.autoRegister() for data-driven effect management.
[ ] 2. (Optional) Shared Buffer Pool: Refactor procedural growth to use a robust kernel-level buffer pool for high-frequency pathfinding.

<- Look:
[DONE] Ping-Pong Architecture: Dual-world simulation for seamless transitions.
[DONE] Unified Quantized Update Loop: Abstracted lifecycle and timing into QuantizedBaseEffect.
