ToDo: 
Go through code and fix all comments.

<- Bugs: 
Fix performance for low-end machines [DONE - Enabled SharedArrayBuffer in Electron]

<- Behavior:

<- Look:
Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. [DONE]

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. [DONE]

Star Power - Make the glitter use the glimmer effect. [DONE]

Implement a multi-monitor configuration? [DONE - Basic support in main.js]

Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper? [DONE - Added electron-builder config]
