ToDo: 
Run tests on all effects, behaviors, sliders, settings, etc. 

<- Bugs: 
There is an issue with the pulse effect - everything should freeze during the effect, but I see a remenant of something that is blocking up code and is moving when everything should be stationary. 


<- Behavior:
Get the quantized effects working as intended. 

<- Look:
Clean up UI.
