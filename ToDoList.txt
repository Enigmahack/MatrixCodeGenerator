ToDo: 
Go through code and fix all comments. [DONE]

<- Behavior:
UI: Add option for double-clicking/tapping sliders to reset to default. [DONE]
UI: Add manual numeric input when clicking slider values. [DONE]
Quantized Editor: Scroll to advance/rewind animation steps. [DONE]

<- Look:
Quantized Pulse Effect: Re-implement the grid overlap effect (Gold glow, 4x4 grid). [DONE]

Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. [DONE]

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. [DONE]
