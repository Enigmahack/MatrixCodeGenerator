ToDo: 
Go through code and fix all comments.

<- Bugs: 

<- Behavior:

<- Look:
Quantized Pulse Effect: Re-implement the grid overlap effect (Gold glow, 4x4 grid). [DONE]

Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. [DONE]

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. [DONE]
