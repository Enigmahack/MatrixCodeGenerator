ToDo: 
Go through code and fix all comments.
Edit the 'Gradual Stream Color' to start from behind the tracer. 
Increase the tracer fade length. 
Deja Vu seems to load the last loaded shader from the custom space into the effects space when running when it shouldn't. 

<- Bugs: 
Fix performance for low-end machines [DONE - Enabled SharedArrayBuffer in Electron]

<- Behavior:

<- Look:
Quantized Pulse Effect: Re-implement the grid overlap effect (Gold glow, 4x4 grid). [DONE]

Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. [DONE]

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. [DONE]
