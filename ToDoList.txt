ToDo: 
Implement a multi-monitor configuration? 
Implement a wrapper to EXE/DMG? Screensaver wrapper?
Go through code and fix all comments.

<- Bugs: 
Fix performance for low-end machines

<- Behavior:
Better toast messaging; errors related to missing fonts, etc.

<- Look:
Quantized Retract: same as above but inwards. This should be pretty easy once the above is done. 

Quantized Expansion: like the pulse, but with the rendered scene transition. This will require taking some generated version, screenshooting the state and using that as the inner scene that stretches. 

Star Power - Make the glitter use the glimmer effect.
